# LSINF2224 - Programming methods

This repository contains the three project of programming methods.

## Project 1: Verification of correctness and termination

Using ESC/Java 2 verification by induction on loops, verify the given Java class by adding annotations (precondition, postcondition, invariant, variant).

This project was graded 9.5/10.

## Project 2: Correction of runtime errors and specifications of class and methods

Using ESC/Java 2 verification, verify and correct the given Java classes by adding annotation (precondition, postcondition, class invariant and ghost variable for data structures).

This project was graded 8/10.

## Project 3: Verification and correction of concurrent Java programs

Using JPF (Java PathFinder) model-checker, verify and correct the given Java classes to ensure the correctness of concurrent executions, model the state-space explosion of the proof and report results with real executions.

This project was graded 10/10.
