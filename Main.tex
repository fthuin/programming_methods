  \section{Demonstration}
  \label{sec:Demonstration}

  The goal of this initial demo is to show how we can automatically verify a
  Java program. We will use \textit{ESC/Java} that uses \textbf{enriched formal
  specifications} to make automated checks.

$(S_{0}, \sigma_{0}) \longrightarrow^{\omega}$ iff there is an \underline{infinite} sequence

$$
(S_{0}, \sigma_{0}) \longrightarrow (S_{1}, \sigma_{1}) \longrightarrow \ldots
$$

$(S,\sigma)$ diverges iff $(S,\sigma) \longrightarrow^{\omega}$

\paragraph{Semantics: Partial Correctness}

We define the semantics of a program $S$ as a function $[[S]]: \sum \rightarrow 2^{\Sigma}$ \newline

initial store $\rightarrow$ final store \newline

Partial correctness semantics:
$$
[[S]](\sigma) = \{\sigma' \mid (S,\sigma) \longrightarrow^{*} (\{\}, \sigma')\}
$$
where $[[S]](\sigma)$ is the set of possible final stores after executing $S$
from $\sigma$

\paragraph{Semantics (Set-Based Version)}

For convenience, it is useful to define $[[S]]$ on sets of initial states. \newline

For a set of stores $X \subseteq \Sigma$,
$$
[[S]](X) = \bigcup_{\sigma \in X} [[S]](\sigma)
$$

\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
  \tikzstyle{suite}=[->,>=stealthâ€™,thick,rounded corners=4pt]

  \draw (1,1) ellipse (1 and 2); % Right big ellipse
  \draw (1,1.5) ellipse (0.5 and 1); % Right little ellipse
  \node (A) at (1, 1.5) {$X$};
  \node (B) at (1, 0.0) {$X'$};
  \draw (5, 1) circle (2); % Right circle
  \draw (5, 2) ellipse (1.25 and 0.75); % Right ellipse in circle
  \node (C) at (5, 2) {$[S](X)$};
  \node (D) at (5, 0) {$[S](X')$};
  \node (E) at (1, 3) {}; % Top-left node
  \node (F) at (5, 3) {}; % Top-right node
  \draw[->,>=latex, very thick] (E)--(F); % Top arrow
  \node (G) at (1,-1) {};
  \node (H) at (5,-1) {};
  \draw[->,>=latex, very thick] (G)--(H); % Bottom arrow
  \node (I) at (0.9, 2.5) {};
  \node (J) at (5, 2.75) {};
  \draw[->,>=latex, very thick] (I)--(J); % Top-ellipse arrow
  \node (K) at (0.9, 0.5) {};
  \node (L) at (5.1, 1.25) {};
  \draw[->,>=latex, very thick] (K)--(L); % Bottom-ellipse arrow
\end{tikzpicture}

\paragraph{Property}: [[S]] is monotonic:

$$
X \subseteq X' \Rightarrow [[S]](X) \subseteq [[S]](X')
$$

\noindent Proof: obvious from definition \newline
Important for convergence of iterative computations \newline

\paragraph{Semantics: Total Correctness}

Distinguished value $\perp$ (bottom) denotes absence of final state (i.e.
the final state of a non-terminating program).

\textbf{Total Correctness Semantics:}
$$
{[[S]]}_{\perp}(\sigma) = [[S]](\sigma) \cup \{\perp \mid (S,\sigma) \longrightarrow^{\omega}\}
$$

${[[S]]}_{\perp}(\sigma)$ is like $[[S]](\sigma)$ plus $\perp$ if $S$ may
diverge from $\sigma$

\paragraph{Semantics: Determinism}

with the language defined so far, programs are deterministic and non-blocking.
If $S \neq \{ \}$, then there is one unique $(S',\sigma')$ such that
$(S,\sigma) \longrightarrow (S', \sigma')$. \newline

Hence $\lvert [[S]](\sigma) \rvert \le 1$ and $\lvert {[[S]]}_{\perp}(\sigma) \rvert = 1$. \\
If $S$ terminates, then $[[S]](\sigma) = {[[S]]}_{\perp}(\sigma) = \{\sigma'\}, \sigma' \neq \perp$ \\
If $S$ diverges, then $[[S]](\sigma) = \emptyset$ and ${[[S]]}_{\perp}(\sigma) = \{\perp\}$. \\
This is not true later with non-deterministic choice and concurrency.

\paragraph{Denotational Semantics}

$[[S]] : \Sigma \rightarrow 2^{\Sigma}$ is a denotation of the semantics of
program S, a mathematical object that fully describes the meaning of $S$.

\textbf{Denotational semantics} defines $[[[S]]](\sigma)$ by induction on $S$,
without resorting to the transition relation.

\begin{framed}
    \textbf{Example} : if-then-else
    $$
    [[\textrm{if } (B) \textrm{ then } S_{1} \textrm{ else } S_{2}]](X) =
    ([[S_{1}]] (X \cap [[B]])) \cup ([[S_{2}]] ( X \cap [[\lnot B]] ))
    $$
\end{framed}

In this course, we will consider operational semantics only.
